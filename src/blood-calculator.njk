      <p>Water makes up an estimated 60% of your body weight. It is a critical chemical component that your body depends on to survive.

The organs, tissues, and cells that form your body require water to function. If you do not consume sufficient water, you will become dehydrated, and this will impact your body's ability to work properly. Even minor cases of dehydration can leave you feeling lethargic and lacking energy.</p>
