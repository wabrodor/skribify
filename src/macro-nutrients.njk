          <h2>The 3 Primary Macronutrients</h2>
          <p>Macronutrients (also known as macros) are nutrients that the body uses in relatively large amounts and therefore needs to receive daily. There are three macronutrients: proteins, carbohydrates, and fats.</p>

           <p>Each of the three primary macronutrients affects the body differently. To make sure that you're getting the right amount of each macronutrient in your diet, it will help to understand the role each macro plays in your body.</p> 

           <p>It is important to include each macronutrient in your daily diet. This will be easier if you build each meal around a combination of protein, carbs, and healthy fats. That said, finding the exact balance of macros that's right for you can be tricky.</p>
