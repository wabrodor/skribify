      <p>Generally, animal protein provides all essential amino acids in the right ratio for you to make full use of them. This makes sense, as animal tissues are similar to your own tissues.If you are eating animal products like meat, fish, eggs, or dairy every day, you are likely getting enough protein.</p>

          <p>Protein is essential to good health. The very origin of the word — from the Greek protos, meaning "first" — reflects protein’s top-shelf status in human nutrition</p>
           <p>You need it to put meat on your bones and to make hair, blood, connective tissue, antibodies, enzymes, and more. It’s common for athletes and bodybuilders to wolf down extra protein to bulk up. But the message the rest of us often get is that our daily protein intake is too high.</p> 
           <p>The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for protein is a modest 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. The RDA is the amount of a nutrient you need to meet your basic nutritional requirements. In a sense, it’s the minimum amount you need to keep from getting sick — not the specific amount you are supposed to eat every day.</p>
